            Iâ€™ve made this recipe for a crowd or for our family (and saved the leftovers for another day), and it turns out great every time!

            ðŸ¥˜ Ingredients
            <ul>
                While the ingredient list is a little bit long, all of these ingredients are easy to find, and thereâ€™s minimal prep time to prepare them for the Instant Pot. Hereâ€™s what you need to make veggie chili in the Instant Pot:
                <li>Olive Oil: Use this oil to sautÃ© â€“ you can also use any other neutral-flavored oil.</li>
                <li>Bell Peppers: Red bell pepper, green bell pepper, and yellow bell pepper give this easy Instant Pot vegetarian chili a bright pop of color. For a time-saver, use a thawed frozen blend. Onions add a Red Onion & Fresh Garlic Cloves: Dice the onion in uniform sizes for even cooking. For garlic, fresh is always best, but you can use jarred, minced garlic if necessary.</li>
                <li>Vegetable Broth: You can easily find this in the grocery store, typically near the other broths.</li>
                <li>Canned Beans: Red kidney beans, black beans, and pinto beans help to make this Instant Pot meatless chili hearty and meaty â€“ without any meat!</li>
                <li>Frozen Corn: Frozen corn cuts prep time, but feel free to use fresh if you prefer.</li>
                <li>Crushed Tomatoes: San Marzano are typically the best variety of tomatoes to use, but you can use any that you prefer or have on hand.</li>
                <li>Spices: I used a combination of chili powder, ground cumin, ground coriander, unsweetened cocoa powder, garlic powder, crushed red peppers, soy sauce, salt, smoked paprika, and regular paprika to give this healthy vegetarian chili a balance of smoky, earthy, spicy flavors.</li>
                <li>Optional Toppings: Shredded cheddar cheese, green onions, diced tomatoes, plain Greek yogurt (or low fat sour cream), tortilla chips.</li>
            </ul>
            One of the best parts about this Instant Pot vegetable chili is its smokiness, which comes from two secret ingredients: unsweetened cocoa powder and smoked paprika.

            It has the deep flavor of traditional meat chilis but itâ€™s much healthier, gluten-free, and vegetarian-friendly, and can easily be made vegan too!
