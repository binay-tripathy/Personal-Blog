            This is the best healthy vegan carrot cake recipe youâ€™ll ever make! This dairy-free, lightened-up carrot cake is soft, moist, and beautifully sweet. Thereâ€™s plenty of cinnamon, allspice, and walnuts in every bite, and itâ€™s topped with a rich vegan cream cheese frosting!


            I have a strong affection for carrot cake. I just canâ€™t resist how delicious it tastes and the aroma while itâ€™s baking. This vegan carrot cake isnâ€™t your typical run-of-the-mill carrot cake recipe. Of course, it has bright, tender, grated carrots, but itâ€™s sweetened with maple syrup as well as crushed pineapple, which gives it a ton of moistness.

                You donâ€™t need much to make this easy vegan carrot cake. Gather your wholesome ingredients, easily found at any grocery store, and get baking! Hereâ€™s a simplified version of the ingredient list for your cake:
                <li>Carrots: Peel the carrots first before finely grating them. Save time by buying pre-grated carrots!</li>
                <li>Orange Juice: As with any ingredient, freshly squeezed is the best. </li>
                <li>Vanilla Extract: Vanilla brings out all of the sweetness of the fruits and the warm flavors of the spices.</li>
                <li>Olive Oil: Using extra virgin olive oil eliminates the need for butter and helps create a moist non dairy carrot cake!</li>
                <li>Maple Syrup: Maple syrup gives the vegan carrot loaf rich sweetness while also replacing any need for refined sugar.</li>
                <li>Pineapple: Be sure to drain the pineapples to avoid adding excess moisture to the cake. Crushed pineapples are perfect for egg free carrot cake!</li>
                <li>All-Purpose Flour & Whole-Wheat Pastry Flour: These two flours helps give the cake its texture.</li>
                <li>Baking Soda: Baking soda helps to make the cake light and moist.</li>
                <li>Cinnamon & Allspice: These two warm spices add incredible flavor and a heavenly aroma to the cake. </li>
                <li>Walnuts: Chopped walnuts give a touch of crunchiness to this delicious vegan carrot cake.</li>
            </ul>
            Whole wheat pastry flour and walnuts add a rich, nutty flavor and a nice dose of whole grains. Each bite will give you a hint of orange flavor from the orange juice in the cake and the orange zest in the homemade icing.

            If youâ€™re in the mood for something irresistible, this healthy vegan carrot cake is waiting for you to make it! Take it to all your family gatherings for the holidays or keep it all to yourself at home!
